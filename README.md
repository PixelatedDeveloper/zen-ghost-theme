# 'Project' Zen
Zen is a rebuilt version of Cambre implementing newer design guidelines. To not make Cambre drasticly different i decided to seperate the two themes.

# Main Features
- UI optimised for different form factors (phone/tablet/pc)
- Ability to set your own publication icon and publication logo.
- Navigation configurable via navigation-section in Ghost panel.
- Author section at the bottom of each post includes avatar and user bio.
- Shows related posts (by primary tag) below a post.
- Set social media links through Ghost settings panel (they will show in the footer)
- Translation support!

# Zen's base
Zen uses the following libraries;
- Bootstrap v4.5.x
- JQuery
- Font Awesome 5

# Theme requirements
- Cambre **requires** Ghost version **4.0.0** or higher to install and work as intended. 
- Enable the Ghost API in the Ghost settings panel -> Labs -> Ghost API for the full featureset (although it's likely on by default if you run the latest version).
